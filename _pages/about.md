Hi! I am a Computer Science student and aspiring (videogame) developer. This is my blog. I am still working on it, so if you see any bugs rest assured I am working on it. Check out the [main page](https://iaotle.github.io) if you want to get in contact, or use the footer icons.
I am passionate about making computers do what I want, and my childhood dream is to be a videogame developer. I am currently working on a game in Unity, and once it becomes good enough to show off you will find it somewhere on my website.



About the theme:
[Reverie](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/reverie) is a Jekyll theme which is simple and opinionated. It's actually a fork of [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) with some additional features and personal touches from amitmerchant1990.
