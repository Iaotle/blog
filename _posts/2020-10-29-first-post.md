Welcome, whoever you are, to my very first blog post! I'm a developer currently working on my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. My main interests include computers and videogames. Currently my main goals in life are career-related, but we will see what the future brings! This blog will be a free-form place to post my thoughts and things I am interested in. If you like computers, videogames, and science, then maybe you would be interested in reading what I have to say!
